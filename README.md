# Space Invaders

This is simple attempt at making a Space Invaders-style clone, built using SDL2 in C++. Defend the planet by shooting down waves of enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen. This game features player movement, shooting mechanics, and a game-over condition when enemies break through your defenses.
